# 📡 Telecom Churn Prediction (Supervised Learning - Classification - Logistic Regression)

## 📌 Project Overview
In the dynamic landscape of the telecom industry, customer churn, or the loss of subscribers, is a pressing concern. The **Telecom Churn Prediction** project leverages **logistic regression**, a machine learning technique, to address this challenge. By analyzing historical customer data and developing a predictive model, this project empowers telecom companies to proactively identify and retain at-risk customers, ultimately improving service quality and business sustainability.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model for churn prediction in the telecom industry. Churn prediction is crucial for telecom companies to retain customers and maintain profitability. By leveraging **logistic regression**, we analyze historical customer data and predict the likelihood of a customer churning. This model assists telecom companies in taking proactive measures to retain at-risk customers and enhance their services, ultimately reducing churn rates and increasing customer satisfaction.

## 🏆 Key Objectives
- Build a predictive model using **logistic regression**.
- Analyze historical customer data to identify patterns leading to churn.
- Develop a tool for telecom companies to predict and reduce churn.
- Contribute to the telecom industry's efforts to improve customer retention and service quality.
